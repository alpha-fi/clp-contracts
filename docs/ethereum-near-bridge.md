# Ethereum-Near Bridge findings

- Bridge between Ethereum - ERC-20 and NEAR NEP-21

- ERC-20 gets locked on ethereum using ethereum contract and minted in NEAR as NEP-21 using NEAR contract. (While transferring from ethereum to NEAR)

- This is done with the help of Bridge (https://github.com/near/rainbow-bridge-cli)

- High level view when we transfer ERC20 token from ETH blockchain to NEAR blockchain. (https://github.com/near/rainbow-bridge-cli/blob/master/docs/workflows/eth2near-fun-transfer.md)

- Example (https://github.com/near-examples/erc20-to-nep21) It will run on local network, for testnet it will be different.
