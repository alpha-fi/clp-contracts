# NEARswap

`NEARswap` it's a smart-contract which is:

* Automated Market Maker
* Continious Liquidity Provider

on NEAR blockchain.

NEAR, with it's unique set of features and scaling potential aspires to be a significant player in the new Decentralize Finance world. Below we will explain a motivation for the NEARswap and why it is important to fulfill the NEAR DeFi mission.


## Why and How?

Our economy heavily depend on the following factors:

- production
- supply chains
- financial services

The latter one enable growth of our economy to new levels through all aspects of asset management and financial derivatives. At its heart, financial services arrange everything from savings accounts to synthetic collateralized debt obligations. With that, access to assets and obligations is a key to scale assets management.

With blockchain we can move financial services to a new level - Decentralized Finance. As noted above, access to assets obligation is a key to scale the economy. Principal solutions to that is:

- Liqidity services
- Automated Market Making.

We build `NEARswap` to fulfill this goals in a very open and decentralized manner. Here are our **GOALS**:

- Focus on liquidity pools and AMM
- Eliminate side markets incentives on NEARswap. Side market is an entity which could change a behavior of the CLP / AMM protocol and shift the benefits or potentially manipulate the whole market.
- Highly predictable behavior designed with the main blockchain principles: trustless smart-contracts.
