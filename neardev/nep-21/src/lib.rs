/**
* Fungible Token implementation with JSON serialization.
* NOTES:
*  - The maximum balance value is limited by U128 (2**128 - 1).
*  - JSON calls should pass U128 as a base-10 string. E.g. "100".
*  - The contract optimizes the inner trie structure by hashing account IDs. It will prevent some
*    abuse of deep tries. Shouldn't be an issue, once NEAR clients implement full hashing of keys.
*  - The contract tracks the change in storage before and after the call. If the storage increases,
*    the contract requires the caller of the contract to attach enough deposit to the function call
*    to cover the storage cost.
*    This is done to prevent a denial of service attack on the contract by taking all available storage.
*    If the storage decreases, the contract will issue a refund for the cost of the released storage.
*    The unused tokens from the attached deposit are also refunded, so it's safe to
*    attach more deposit than required.
*  - To prevent the deployed contract from being modified or deleted, it should not have any access
*    keys on its account.
