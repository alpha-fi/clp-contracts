* Example has working ABND Token by default.

* It is put up by NEAR team.

* I have made a custom ERC-20 token. 

* For custom tokens we need to deploy connector contracts with addressess of deployed ERC-20 and NEP21 (FT)

* I have deployed ERC-20 , working on deploying NEP21, then tokenLocker contract will be deployed

* This way we will create a new bridge for our tokens
